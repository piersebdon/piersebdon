### Hiya ðŸ‘‹,

I'm Piers, a software developer working full time as an iOS developer.

[Swift](https://swift.org) is my programming language of choice and I am really excited about it's potential use outside of the Apple ecosystem, particuarly server-side Swift.

I currently sponsor [Vapor](https://vapor.codes), the most popular server-side Swift web framework and also like to keep an eye out on MongoDB's native swift framework, [MongoSwift](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-swift-driver). I would defintely recommend using both for your next iOS project or startup.
